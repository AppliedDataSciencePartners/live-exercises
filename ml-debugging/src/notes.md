# the notes while debugging

1. train on the training data instead on testing data
2. remove target from X
3. n_estimators in random forest - could have written a code to cross validate, but chose a value that is usually accepted
4. mismatch of columns in the training and testing set
5. Encoded Pclass
6. corrected the formulas for accuracy, precision and recall
